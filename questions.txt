1.Design a non deterministic PDA for accepting the language L = {an bn | n>=1}

2.Construct a DFA for L = {ab^n a^m : n ≥ 2, m ≥ 3}

3.Draw a DFA for the language accepting strings ending with ‘0011’ over input
alphabets ∑ = {0, 1}

4.Construct npda’s that accept the following languages on Σ = {a, b, c}.
L = {a^n b^m c^(n+m) : n ≥ 0, m ≥ 0}

5.Construction of a minimal DFA accepting set of strings over {a, b} in which
every ‘a’ is never be followed by ‘bb’.

12.Construct an NFA that accepts the language {ab, abc}*. This is the set of strings
where ab and abc may be repeated. Example strings include abcab, ababcab,
abcabcabc, and the empty string

13.Draw a DFA for the language accepting strings ending with ‘abb’ over input
alphabets ∑ = {a, b}

alphabets ∑ = {a, b}

15.Draw a deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata which accept a string
containing “the” anywhere in a string of {a-z}, e.g., “there” but not “those”.

16.Draw a deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata which accept a string
containing “ing” at the end of a string in a string of {a-z}, e.g., “anything” but not
“anywhere”.
